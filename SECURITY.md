# Security

## Supported versions

The latest tagged release and the current `main` branch are supported.

## Runtime behavior

At runtime, `claude-usage-monitor` does the following:

- Reads session JSON from Claude Code on `stdin`
- Reads the OAuth token needed for `claudeAiOauth.accessToken`, unless `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is already set: first the macOS Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`), falling back to the legacy `~/.claude/.credentials.json` file
- Runs `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` in the current project to show the active branch
- Writes a cache file and lock file in your system temp directory:
  `claude-sl-usage.json` and `claude-sl-usage.lock`
- Makes an HTTPS request to `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`

It does not install dependencies, ship analytics, or send repository contents, prompts, or local files to any service other than Anthropic's usage endpoint.

## Installer behavior

The installers copy these files into `~/.claude/plugins/claude-usage-monitor`:

- `statusline.py`
- `statusline.sh`
- `statusline.cmd`

They also update `~/.claude/settings.json` to point `statusLine.command` at the installed launcher and create `settings.json.bak` before overwriting an existing settings file.
